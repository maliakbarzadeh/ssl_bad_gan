\section{Conclusions}
In this work, we present a semi-supervised learning framework that uses generated data to boost task performance. 
Under this framework, we characterize the properties of various generators and theoretically prove that a complementary (i.e. bad) generator improves generalization.
Empirically our proposed method improves the performance of image classification on several benchmark datasets.
